## Prerequisites
To sign the application, you're going to need Mac OS X 10.9 or newer and Xcode 7 or newer.

In order to install the signed application to your device you're going to need a cable.

For the Apple TV 4, you'll need either a [USB-A to USB-C cable](http://amzn.to/1RHIQ5k) or a [USB-C to USB-C cable](http://amzn.to/1JGxDks).

For iOS devices, you'll need your [standard sync cable](http://amzn.to/1RHJJuA).

## Usage
If you have a paid developer account or a signing certificate and provisioning profile, you can skip to step 7 and just use your signing certificate and the profile.

1. Open Xcode and create a new iOS or tvOS application depending on your device type

2. Type in a name and identifier (choose something unique, something like com.yourname.kodi)

3. Xcode will complain about the provisioning profile, click fix issue

   **If you have additional devices**
   
      * Plug in the device
      * Go to the Product Menu
      * Under Destination, select your device
      * Repeat from step 3
	
6. Xcode should no longer be complaining
